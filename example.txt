This is a testing file. I upload this to github!

this is a new line

//mkdir - make directory
//cp - copy
//mv - move
//ls - list
//cd - change directory

git clone
    then change directory (cd .\<githublink>)

save the file, 
    git add,
    git commit -m <name>,
    git push

git init
git ignore

git branch - to know which branch i am currently working on
git checkout -b <name of branch> - to make a new branch, naming the new branch
git checkout <branch name> - change to the branch from another branch

git diff <branch name>
